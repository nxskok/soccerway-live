get live games from scoresway

```{r live-games-1}
library(tidyverse)
library(lubridate)
```

does it work to just grab live games from `games`?

```{r live-games-2}
games <- read_rds("~/Documents/r-projects/scoresway/rds/games.rds")
games %>% mutate(ago = (time_stamp - now())/dhours(1)) %>% 
  filter(between(ago, -3, 12)) %>% 
  select(match, country, comp_name, t1_name, t2_name, time_stamp) -> games1
games1 %>% 
  knitr::kable()
games1 %>% pull(match) -> mtch
mtch
```

this might work and seems to (though may not be efficient)
